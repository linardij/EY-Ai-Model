Industry Reports from EIU
Industry Reports provide EIU's forecasts for six industries, along with relevant market
analysis. They focus on sectoral and subsectoral demand in the world's major
economies, and are updated quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the
country (see schedule at the end of this report).
The Industry Reports are driven by the country-based macroeconomic forecasts, for
which EIU is renowned. An EIU expert examines our forecasts for the key indicators
in each industry, taking into account economic and political developments, global
and regional trends, and market- or competitor-specific factors that are likely to have
an impact on the sector in the future. The analyst then provides commentary to
outline the implications of these trends for companies in the industry.
EIU's country and industry analysis draws on the expertise of 100 in-house editors
and economists, including industry specialists, and a global network of more than
600 contributors. The historical industry data on which our forecasts are based come
from a variety of sources. As with all of EIU's analysis, we select the most
dependable and up-to-date sources available.

Financial services report
Overview • Indonesia has a well-established financial system, but one that still has only
limited reach among the general population and ample room for future
growth. Financial service firms have recovered from their subdued
performance during the covid-19 pandemic. The country will enjoy some of
the fastest growth rates among emerging economies during EIU's forecast
period (2024-28). The main growth drivers will be commodity exports,
industrial deepening, and consumption, while a boom in the digital finance
and financial technology (fintech) segments will aid the financial services
sector over the forecast period.
• Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to shifts in global investor sentiment,
considering its ballooning fiscal and current account deficits. Nevertheless,
financial firms are well equipped, with sufficient capital and liquidity levels.
• With an estimated population of 276.4m in 2024, Indonesia is home to
nearly 40% of the population of the Association of South-East Asian Nations
(ASEAN). The country has a larger domestic market than its regional peers,
but its business environment is more challenging than those of Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam, with poor infrastructure and cumbersome
bureaucracy, including widespread corruption.
• Indonesia's financial sector is relatively small, accounting for 4.2% of GDP in
2023 (up from 3.7% a decade earlier), according to Statistics Indonesia.
Financial and insurance activity accounted for 1.2% of total employment in
2023 (the same proportion as in 2012).
• Banks dominate the country's financial sector. The largest banks are state-
controlled but operate largely as commercial entities, and their shares are
traded publicly on the local stock market. Foreign lenders, notably from Japan
and elsewhere in ASEAN, have expanded operations to Indonesia in
recent years.
• The country has small insurance and mutual fund markets, as well as a
thriving fintech segment, focused primarily on payments. The rapid
expansion of fintech, favourable demographics and economic expansion
provide strong growth opportunities for both domestic and foreign financial
firms.
• Real GDP growth will pick up only marginally in 2024, to 5.1% from 5% in
2023. We forecast that GDP will expand by an average of 5.1% in 2024-28.
Private consumption remains the biggest driver of growth, given the country's
strong consumption base. Inflation averaged 3.7% in 2023, within the target
range of 2-4% set for 2023 by Bank Indonesia (BI, the central bank). BI has
lowered its inflation target to 1.5-3.5% for 2024. With the central bank's surprise
rate increase in late April and transitory inflation, we have revised down our
forecast for average inflation in 2024 from 3.2% to 2.6%.
• Although the local currency, the rupiah, has been appreciating recently, the re-
election of Donald Trump (which is our baseline forecast for the November
US presidential election) is likely to eat up much of the gain, prompting BI to
maintain its key policy rate until the fourth quarter of 2024.

• Following the general election in February 2024, Prabowo Subianto, the
defence minister in the outgoing government, will succeed Joko Widodo as
president. Mr Prabowo is expected to maintain a large but loose-knit coalition
to minimise internal conflict over policy.
• An omnibus bill to reform the financial sector and the mandate of BI was
enacted in January 2023. The law alters existing legislation, primarily to
consolidate regulation and the supervision of types of finance under a
smaller number of statutes and to provide a clearer purview for the Financial
Services Authority (OJK). It contains new rules to govern fintech, including
improved data protection. Controversially, it allows the Financial System
Stability Committee to direct BI to purchase sovereign bonds in the primary
market during periods of economic crisis—an initiative that was started
during the pandemic but was due to be wound down. The change risks
undermining the central bank's independence and, in turn, price stability.
Banks
Indonesia has a large but concentrated banking industry, with the five biggest
players accounting for more than half of the industry's assets in 2023. Over the
past decade, banks in the country have consistently enjoyed strong credit
growth, healthy profits and buoyant net-interest margins, which are among the
best in ASEAN. The country has a growing Islamic finance industry, with
sharia-compliant assets making up one-tenth of the total assets in the country's
financial system.
There were 105 commercial banks and 1,405 rural banks in Indonesia at the end
of 2023, with 24,276 commercial bank branches and 6,049 rural branches in
operation, according to the OJK, the principal regulator. Total assets of
commercial banks stood at Rp12,048trn (US$790.7bn), while rural banks held a
significantly smaller asset size.
Increased use of smartphones, coupled with an e-commerce boom, has given
rise to a booming fintech segment, which raises hope for improved access to
banking and savings products for the country's large underbanked population.
At end-2023 there were 101 fintech lending companies, including seven firms
that provided Islamic financing services, according to the OJK.
The financial sector has developed rapidly since the covid-19 outbreak of 2020,
when it experienced its first annual dip in profits since 2015, according to IMF
data. The industry as a whole posted a nominal 20% rise in pre-tax profits, to
Rp303.9trn in 2023. This came after a 45.2% rise in pre-tax profits to Rp252.3trn in
2022 and a 32.2% rise in 2021. Earnings growth was somewhat weaker when
adjusted for inflation. Indonesia's consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.6%, year
on year, in 2023, and by an average of 5.5% in 2022 and 1.9% in 2021.

Banks had a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of 24.2% at the end of 2023—the highest
level since 2011, according to the IMF. This ratio compares high-quality base
capital to risk-weighted assets. The percentage fell moderately, to 22.7% at the
end of the first quarter of 2024， partly owing to elevated interest rates. Another
measure of bank capital, the leverage ratio, improved gradually from 12.6% in
2020 to 13.4% at end-2023. The leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to overall
assets without any risk weighting.
The country's banking industry has also done well on other prudential
indicators. Its ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities stood at 24% at end-
2023, which would allow lenders to honour withdrawals amid a surge in
requests. Its loan-to-deposit rate stood concurrently at 84%, which means that
credit extension to borrowers relies on inexpensive and stable deposit funding,
rather than capital markets. Return on equity stood at a solid 14.4% at end-2023,
up from 9% in 2021 and 12% in 2022, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels.
Bad loans have posed a problem for the industry in the past, in particular after
the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. However, non-performing loans (NPLs)
stood at just 2% of total loans at the end of the first quarter of 2024, down from
2.6% at end-2021, according to the IMF.
The raising of policy rates that began in August 2022 has yet to drive an
increase in the already ample net interest margin that Indonesian banks enjoy.
The industry-wide margin stood at 4.8% at the end of 2023, up slightly from 4.7%
a year earlier, according to BI. It had slipped gradually in previous years, from
5.1% at end-2018 to 4.5% at end-2021. We expect the rate spread to narrow
gradually across our forecast period as banks face greater competition between
themselves and other lenders, particularly fintech lenders.

To counteract inflation, BI lifted its policy rate, the seven-day repo rate, from
3.5% in July 2022 to 6% in October 2023. In April 2024, in a surprise move, the
central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%, with the aim of
arresting the rupiah’s decline. In its monetary policy decision on August 2024,
BI left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6.25%—a rate sufficient to
support the rupiah, especially amid the increasing prospect of it cutting rates
soon, and to curb inflationary pressures that have built up in recent months.
Currently at its highest level since 2019, the rate is not expected to change before
the final quarter of 2024.
Lending growth accelerated in 2022 and 2023, following tepid expansion in the
preceding two years. Banks' non-interbank credit outstanding grew by a
nominal 7.9% to Rp7.5trn in 2023, after rising by 11% in 2022, according to the
IMF. Deposits grew relatively slowly, expanding by 4.2% in 2023, following
growth of 10.4% in 2022 and 11.6% in 2021. At end-2023 deposits amounted
to Rp7.9trn. It has started to accelerate in 2024， recording a 6.2% rise in the first
quarter of 2024.
Outstanding loans to individuals, which account for around 40% of the total
credit of commercial lenders, grew by 8.8% in 2022 and 9% in 2023, to Rp3.3trn,
according to BI. Growth slowed to 10.2%, year on year, by the end of the second
quarter of 2024. Consumer loans, which account for less than 60% of
outstanding credit to individuals, expanded by 9.4% in 2022 and then by 9%,
year on year, to Rp2trn in 2023. Housing credit, which makes up about 20% of
household borrowing, rose by 7.8% in 2022 and by 12.5%, year on year, to
Rp659.7bn at end-2023. Growth accelerated further and reached 14% by the end
of the second quarter of 2024.
Private-sector companies are the second-largest category of borrowers,
accounting for about two-fifths of outstanding bank credit. Credit to private
non-financial firms rebounded sharply in 2022, marking a gain of 11.6%, far
faster than the 5.1% recorded in 2021. It then expanded by 10.8%, year on year, to
Rp5trn at end-2023.
Four of the five largest Indonesian banks—Bank Rakyat Indonesia,
Bank Mandiri, Bank Negara Indonesia and Bank Tabungan Negara—are majority
state-owned, partly as a result of rescues carried out during the Asian financial
crisis of the late 1990s. All four have local stockmarket listings and operate as
commercial ventures, however. The fifth, Bank Central Asia, is controlled by
Djarum Group, a private conglomerate, although it has also offered shares to
the general public.
Foreign investment has introduced greater competition in the banking sector via
new products and services, and bolstered the sector's creditworthiness.
The largest foreign-controlled lenders are CIMB Niaga (CIMB, Malaysia),
PermataBank (Bangkok Bank, Thailand), Bank OCBC NISP (OCBC, Singapore),
Bank BTPN (SMBC, Japan) and Bank Danamon Indonesia (Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group, Japan).

Other major foreign players with a presence in Indonesia include Malaysia's
Maybank and Singapore's DBS and UOB. In January 2022 UOB agreed to buy
the consumer banking units of Citibank (US) in Indonesia, as well as in
Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The acquisitions closed in Malaysia and
Thailand in November 2022 and in Vietnam in February 2023. Acquisition of
the Indonesian business was completed in November 2023.
Islamic banks (typically called sharia in English, but syariah in Indonesian),
account for about one-tenth of banking industry assets. They have grown in
importance over the years, offering the same services as other banks, with the
important difference that returns are generated via profit-sharing and other
religious teaching-complied mechanisms, rather than through interest charges.
The industry is regulated in tandem with the Indonesian Ulema Council,
a state-funded national umbrella group comprising scholars and leaders from
Indonesian Muslim organisations.
The sector received a boost in February 2021 with the merger of the Islamic
units of Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia,
three of the four largest Islamic lenders. The new merged state-owned bank,
Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), is Indonesia's largest sharia financial institution
and the industry's sixth-largest overall. This has attracted the interest of
companies from other countries that are heavily involved in Islamic banking.
Reports suggest that the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank is interested in investing in
BSI. The financial regulator has also encouraged the merger of smaller private
lenders. In November 2023 the OJK released a roadmap for strengthening
Islamic banking to 2027, which focuses on how to structure Islamic banks’
resilience and accelerate digitalisation.
At the end of June 2024, there were 14 sharia commercial banks with
2,008 offices, and 173 rural sharia banks with 678 offices. There were also
19 conventional lenders with Islamic banking units, maintaining 384 offices.
The country's total Islamic banking assets amounted to Rp874.1trn at that time,
of which sharia commercial banks held Rp606.9trn. Sharia commercial banks
had a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 25.5%, up from 25.4% in end-2023.
Their non-performing financing ratio eased to 2%, down from 2.1% in end-2023.

There has been growing foreign interest in Indonesia's new digital banks. These
come in two types in Indonesia: the digital banking arms of commercial banks
and neo-banks (digital financial institutions), which are typically set up by
companies that acquire local lenders or commercial banks. The OJK
implemented updated guidelines on digital banking in October 2021.
In February 2023 Bank Fama International was rebranded as Super Bank
Indonesia in a move to digital services. Bank Central Asia acquired the smaller
Bank Royal Indonesia in 2019 and has turned it into a fully digital bank,
Bank Digital BCA, targeting the millennial demographic. In November 2023 the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced an agreement to sell its
Indonesian banking unit, Bank Commonwealth, to a subsidiary of Singapore's
OCBC for US$140.7m. The sale was completed in May 2024.
A digital bank is subject to the same capital and licensing requirements as a
conventional bank and must have minimum paid-up capital of Rp10trn.
Foreign shareholders can own up to 99% of a digital bank, subject to OJK
approval. A digital bank can be set up either from scratch or through a
transformation from an existing bank.
Digital payments
An increasing number of Indonesians have enrolled in formal financial
accounts in recent years, but almost half of the population remains unbanked.
According to the latest World Bank's database on financial inclusion, about 52%
of the population above the age of 15 had an individual or shared account at a
formal financial institution in 2021, up from 49% in 2017 and 20% in 2011.
According to the survey, 35% had a debit card, but fewer than 2% had a credit
card. Around 9% had used mobile money, and a similar level had used a
mobile phone or the internet to check an account balance. A high level of
mobile subscriptions and improvements in internet connections will be the
main drivers behind a rise in digital transactions. Indonesia aims to raise the
financial inclusion rate to 90% in 2024 (from 76% at end-2022).
Over the past few years, Indonesia has experienced strong growth in the reach
of fintech operators, particularly in the payments business. The development,
tracking a boom in e-commerce, has been driven by increased access to the
internet, widespread adoption of smartphones and the relative youth of the
population. The pandemic outbreak further advanced the use of e-wallets and
payment platforms such as PayPal (US), GoPay (owned GoTo Group, an
Indonesian Internet company), Ovo (part of the domestic Lippo Group), Dana
(a subsidiary of Elang Sejahtera Mandiri), LinkAja (an interbank network) and
ShopeePay (owned by a Singaporean e-commerce firm, Shopee). Fintech players
are also increasing their presence in the Islamic banking segment, providing
sharia-compliant products and services.
Traditional banks are also launching digital payment options to compete with
emerging fintech players. For example, Bank Mandiri has launched two digital
applications, including its digital banking platform, Livin'.
