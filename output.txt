Industry Reports from EIU
Industry Reports provide EIU's forecasts for six industries, along with relevant market
analysis. They focus on sectoral and subsectoral demand in the world's major
economies, and are updated quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the
country (see schedule at the end of this report).
The Industry Reports are driven by the country-based macroeconomic forecasts, for
which EIU is renowned. An EIU expert examines our forecasts for the key indicators
in each industry, taking into account economic and political developments, global
and regional trends, and market- or competitor-specific factors that are likely to have
an impact on the sector in the future. The analyst then provides commentary to
outline the implications of these trends for companies in the industry.
EIU's country and industry analysis draws on the expertise of 100 in-house editors
and economists, including industry specialists, and a global network of more than
600 contributors. The historical industry data on which our forecasts are based come
from a variety of sources. As with all of EIU's analysis, we select the most
dependable and up-to-date sources available.

Financial services report
Overview • Indonesia has a well-established financial system, but one that still has only
limited reach among the general population and ample room for future
growth. Financial service firms have recovered from their subdued
performance during the covid-19 pandemic. The country will enjoy some of
the fastest growth rates among emerging economies during EIU's forecast
period (2024-28). The main growth drivers will be commodity exports,
industrial deepening, and consumption, while a boom in the digital finance
and financial technology (fintech) segments will aid the financial services
sector over the forecast period.
• Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to shifts in global investor sentiment,
considering its ballooning fiscal and current account deficits. Nevertheless,
financial firms are well equipped, with sufficient capital and liquidity levels.
• With an estimated population of 276.4m in 2024, Indonesia is home to
nearly 40% of the population of the Association of South-East Asian Nations
(ASEAN). The country has a larger domestic market than its regional peers,
but its business environment is more challenging than those of Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam, with poor infrastructure and cumbersome
bureaucracy, including widespread corruption.
• Indonesia's financial sector is relatively small, accounting for 4.2% of GDP in
2023 (up from 3.7% a decade earlier), according to Statistics Indonesia.
Financial and insurance activity accounted for 1.2% of total employment in
2023 (the same proportion as in 2012).
• Banks dominate the country's financial sector. The largest banks are state-
controlled but operate largely as commercial entities, and their shares are
traded publicly on the local stock market. Foreign lenders, notably from Japan
and elsewhere in ASEAN, have expanded operations to Indonesia in
recent years.
• The country has small insurance and mutual fund markets, as well as a
thriving fintech segment, focused primarily on payments. The rapid
expansion of fintech, favourable demographics and economic expansion
provide strong growth opportunities for both domestic and foreign financial
firms.
• Real GDP growth will pick up only marginally in 2024, to 5.1% from 5% in
2023. We forecast that GDP will expand by an average of 5.1% in 2024-28.
Private consumption remains the biggest driver of growth, given the country's
strong consumption base. Inflation averaged 3.7% in 2023, within the target
range of 2-4% set for 2023 by Bank Indonesia (BI, the central bank). BI has
lowered its inflation target to 1.5-3.5% for 2024. With the central bank's surprise
rate increase in late April and transitory inflation, we have revised down our
forecast for average inflation in 2024 from 3.2% to 2.6%.
• Although the local currency, the rupiah, has been appreciating recently, the re-
election of Donald Trump (which is our baseline forecast for the November
US presidential election) is likely to eat up much of the gain, prompting BI to
maintain its key policy rate until the fourth quarter of 2024.

• Following the general election in February 2024, Prabowo Subianto, the
defence minister in the outgoing government, will succeed Joko Widodo as
president. Mr Prabowo is expected to maintain a large but loose-knit coalition
to minimise internal conflict over policy.
• An omnibus bill to reform the financial sector and the mandate of BI was
enacted in January 2023. The law alters existing legislation, primarily to
consolidate regulation and the supervision of types of finance under a
smaller number of statutes and to provide a clearer purview for the Financial
Services Authority (OJK). It contains new rules to govern fintech, including
improved data protection. Controversially, it allows the Financial System
Stability Committee to direct BI to purchase sovereign bonds in the primary
market during periods of economic crisis—an initiative that was started
during the pandemic but was due to be wound down. The change risks
undermining the central bank's independence and, in turn, price stability.
Banks
Indonesia has a large but concentrated banking industry, with the five biggest
players accounting for more than half of the industry's assets in 2023. Over the
past decade, banks in the country have consistently enjoyed strong credit
growth, healthy profits and buoyant net-interest margins, which are among the
best in ASEAN. The country has a growing Islamic finance industry, with
sharia-compliant assets making up one-tenth of the total assets in the country's
financial system.
There were 105 commercial banks and 1,405 rural banks in Indonesia at the end
of 2023, with 24,276 commercial bank branches and 6,049 rural branches in
operation, according to the OJK, the principal regulator. Total assets of
commercial banks stood at Rp12,048trn (US$790.7bn), while rural banks held a
significantly smaller asset size.
Increased use of smartphones, coupled with an e-commerce boom, has given
rise to a booming fintech segment, which raises hope for improved access to
banking and savings products for the country's large underbanked population.
At end-2023 there were 101 fintech lending companies, including seven firms
that provided Islamic financing services, according to the OJK.
The financial sector has developed rapidly since the covid-19 outbreak of 2020,
when it experienced its first annual dip in profits since 2015, according to IMF
data. The industry as a whole posted a nominal 20% rise in pre-tax profits, to
Rp303.9trn in 2023. This came after a 45.2% rise in pre-tax profits to Rp252.3trn in
2022 and a 32.2% rise in 2021. Earnings growth was somewhat weaker when
adjusted for inflation. Indonesia's consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.6%, year
on year, in 2023, and by an average of 5.5% in 2022 and 1.9% in 2021.

Banks had a strong Tier 1 capital ratio of 24.2% at the end of 2023—the highest
level since 2011, according to the IMF. This ratio compares high-quality base
capital to risk-weighted assets. The percentage fell moderately, to 22.7% at the
end of the first quarter of 2024， partly owing to elevated interest rates. Another
measure of bank capital, the leverage ratio, improved gradually from 12.6% in
2020 to 13.4% at end-2023. The leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to overall
assets without any risk weighting.
The country's banking industry has also done well on other prudential
indicators. Its ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities stood at 24% at end-
2023, which would allow lenders to honour withdrawals amid a surge in
requests. Its loan-to-deposit rate stood concurrently at 84%, which means that
credit extension to borrowers relies on inexpensive and stable deposit funding,
rather than capital markets. Return on equity stood at a solid 14.4% at end-2023,
up from 9% in 2021 and 12% in 2022, marking a return to pre-pandemic levels.
Bad loans have posed a problem for the industry in the past, in particular after
the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. However, non-performing loans (NPLs)
stood at just 2% of total loans at the end of the first quarter of 2024, down from
2.6% at end-2021, according to the IMF.
The raising of policy rates that began in August 2022 has yet to drive an
increase in the already ample net interest margin that Indonesian banks enjoy.
The industry-wide margin stood at 4.8% at the end of 2023, up slightly from 4.7%
a year earlier, according to BI. It had slipped gradually in previous years, from
5.1% at end-2018 to 4.5% at end-2021. We expect the rate spread to narrow
gradually across our forecast period as banks face greater competition between
themselves and other lenders, particularly fintech lenders.

To counteract inflation, BI lifted its policy rate, the seven-day repo rate, from
3.5% in July 2022 to 6% in October 2023. In April 2024, in a surprise move, the
central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%, with the aim of
arresting the rupiah’s decline. In its monetary policy decision on August 2024,
BI left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6.25%—a rate sufficient to
support the rupiah, especially amid the increasing prospect of it cutting rates
soon, and to curb inflationary pressures that have built up in recent months.
Currently at its highest level since 2019, the rate is not expected to change before
the final quarter of 2024.
Lending growth accelerated in 2022 and 2023, following tepid expansion in the
preceding two years. Banks' non-interbank credit outstanding grew by a
nominal 7.9% to Rp7.5trn in 2023, after rising by 11% in 2022, according to the
IMF. Deposits grew relatively slowly, expanding by 4.2% in 2023, following
growth of 10.4% in 2022 and 11.6% in 2021. At end-2023 deposits amounted
to Rp7.9trn. It has started to accelerate in 2024， recording a 6.2% rise in the first
quarter of 2024.
Outstanding loans to individuals, which account for around 40% of the total
credit of commercial lenders, grew by 8.8% in 2022 and 9% in 2023, to Rp3.3trn,
according to BI. Growth slowed to 10.2%, year on year, by the end of the second
quarter of 2024. Consumer loans, which account for less than 60% of
outstanding credit to individuals, expanded by 9.4% in 2022 and then by 9%,
year on year, to Rp2trn in 2023. Housing credit, which makes up about 20% of
household borrowing, rose by 7.8% in 2022 and by 12.5%, year on year, to
Rp659.7bn at end-2023. Growth accelerated further and reached 14% by the end
of the second quarter of 2024.
Private-sector companies are the second-largest category of borrowers,
accounting for about two-fifths of outstanding bank credit. Credit to private
non-financial firms rebounded sharply in 2022, marking a gain of 11.6%, far
faster than the 5.1% recorded in 2021. It then expanded by 10.8%, year on year, to
Rp5trn at end-2023.
Four of the five largest Indonesian banks—Bank Rakyat Indonesia,
Bank Mandiri, Bank Negara Indonesia and Bank Tabungan Negara—are majority
state-owned, partly as a result of rescues carried out during the Asian financial
crisis of the late 1990s. All four have local stockmarket listings and operate as
commercial ventures, however. The fifth, Bank Central Asia, is controlled by
Djarum Group, a private conglomerate, although it has also offered shares to
the general public.
Foreign investment has introduced greater competition in the banking sector via
new products and services, and bolstered the sector's creditworthiness.
The largest foreign-controlled lenders are CIMB Niaga (CIMB, Malaysia),
PermataBank (Bangkok Bank, Thailand), Bank OCBC NISP (OCBC, Singapore),
Bank BTPN (SMBC, Japan) and Bank Danamon Indonesia (Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group, Japan).

Other major foreign players with a presence in Indonesia include Malaysia's
Maybank and Singapore's DBS and UOB. In January 2022 UOB agreed to buy
the consumer banking units of Citibank (US) in Indonesia, as well as in
Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. The acquisitions closed in Malaysia and
Thailand in November 2022 and in Vietnam in February 2023. Acquisition of
the Indonesian business was completed in November 2023.
Islamic banks (typically called sharia in English, but syariah in Indonesian),
account for about one-tenth of banking industry assets. They have grown in
importance over the years, offering the same services as other banks, with the
important difference that returns are generated via profit-sharing and other
religious teaching-complied mechanisms, rather than through interest charges.
The industry is regulated in tandem with the Indonesian Ulema Council,
a state-funded national umbrella group comprising scholars and leaders from
Indonesian Muslim organisations.
The sector received a boost in February 2021 with the merger of the Islamic
units of Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia,
three of the four largest Islamic lenders. The new merged state-owned bank,
Bank Syariah Indonesia (BSI), is Indonesia's largest sharia financial institution
and the industry's sixth-largest overall. This has attracted the interest of
companies from other countries that are heavily involved in Islamic banking.
Reports suggest that the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank is interested in investing in
BSI. The financial regulator has also encouraged the merger of smaller private
lenders. In November 2023 the OJK released a roadmap for strengthening
Islamic banking to 2027, which focuses on how to structure Islamic banks’
resilience and accelerate digitalisation.
At the end of June 2024, there were 14 sharia commercial banks with
2,008 offices, and 173 rural sharia banks with 678 offices. There were also
19 conventional lenders with Islamic banking units, maintaining 384 offices.
The country's total Islamic banking assets amounted to Rp874.1trn at that time,
of which sharia commercial banks held Rp606.9trn. Sharia commercial banks
had a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 25.5%, up from 25.4% in end-2023.
Their non-performing financing ratio eased to 2%, down from 2.1% in end-2023.

There has been growing foreign interest in Indonesia's new digital banks. These
come in two types in Indonesia: the digital banking arms of commercial banks
and neo-banks (digital financial institutions), which are typically set up by
companies that acquire local lenders or commercial banks. The OJK
implemented updated guidelines on digital banking in October 2021.
In February 2023 Bank Fama International was rebranded as Super Bank
Indonesia in a move to digital services. Bank Central Asia acquired the smaller
Bank Royal Indonesia in 2019 and has turned it into a fully digital bank,
Bank Digital BCA, targeting the millennial demographic. In November 2023 the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced an agreement to sell its
Indonesian banking unit, Bank Commonwealth, to a subsidiary of Singapore's
OCBC for US$140.7m. The sale was completed in May 2024.
A digital bank is subject to the same capital and licensing requirements as a
conventional bank and must have minimum paid-up capital of Rp10trn.
Foreign shareholders can own up to 99% of a digital bank, subject to OJK
approval. A digital bank can be set up either from scratch or through a
transformation from an existing bank.
Digital payments
An increasing number of Indonesians have enrolled in formal financial
accounts in recent years, but almost half of the population remains unbanked.
According to the latest World Bank's database on financial inclusion, about 52%
of the population above the age of 15 had an individual or shared account at a
formal financial institution in 2021, up from 49% in 2017 and 20% in 2011.
According to the survey, 35% had a debit card, but fewer than 2% had a credit
card. Around 9% had used mobile money, and a similar level had used a
mobile phone or the internet to check an account balance. A high level of
mobile subscriptions and improvements in internet connections will be the
main drivers behind a rise in digital transactions. Indonesia aims to raise the
financial inclusion rate to 90% in 2024 (from 76% at end-2022).
Over the past few years, Indonesia has experienced strong growth in the reach
of fintech operators, particularly in the payments business. The development,
tracking a boom in e-commerce, has been driven by increased access to the
internet, widespread adoption of smartphones and the relative youth of the
population. The pandemic outbreak further advanced the use of e-wallets and
payment platforms such as PayPal (US), GoPay (owned GoTo Group, an
Indonesian Internet company), Ovo (part of the domestic Lippo Group), Dana
(a subsidiary of Elang Sejahtera Mandiri), LinkAja (an interbank network) and
ShopeePay (owned by a Singaporean e-commerce firm, Shopee). Fintech players
are also increasing their presence in the Islamic banking segment, providing
sharia-compliant products and services.
Traditional banks are also launching digital payment options to compete with
emerging fintech players. For example, Bank Mandiri has launched two digital
applications, including its digital banking platform, Livin'.

In May 2021 two of Indonesia's largest technology companies, Tokopedia and
Gojek, merged to create a new digital giant in the area of e-commerce,
ride-hailing and financial services. The new entity, GoTo, made a local initial
public offering (IPO) in April 2022, raising US$1.1bn.
In general, fintech lending competes directly with informal moneylenders,
micro-finance institutions and small banks. Traditional financial institutions
tend to focus on big clients and larger collateralised loans of longer duration,
whereas fintech firms provide loans to small or less creditworthy clients that
are of lower value, uncollateralised and of short duration.
Cash (38%) remained the dominant way to make in-person payments in 2023,
ahead of digital wallets (32%), credit cards (15%) and debit cards (11%), according
to WorldPay, a provider of payment devices and services. In contrast, non-cash
payments dominated e-commerce sales: digital wallets (40%), bank transfers
(28%), credit cards (10%) and debit cards (7%). Cash on delivery was still used for
11% of transactions.
The main Indonesian global payment card and app brands are the US-based
Visa and Mastercard, with 42% and 39% of the market, respectively, in 2023,
according to WorldPay. BI's National Payment Gateway (Gerbang Pembayaran
Nasional, GPN) commands a 13% market share.
Digital payments are going regional. In late 2022 Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines and Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
to boost regional connectivity using local-currency settlements, in order to
remove the need to convert to US dollars. Under the MoU, a QR payment
linkage will allow instant cross-border payments for goods and services. The
system is already active between Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Singapore
officially launched the payment feature in November 2023, and the Philippines
is likely to participate in the near future.
The use of QR codes for payment, which was pioneered by China, has taken
off rapidly across Asia. Tencent, the parent company of WeChat Pay, one of the
largest payment platforms in China, partnered with a local player, Allo Bank, in
July 2023 to work on digital payment solutions. In November 2021 BI signed an
MoU with the Central Bank of the UAE to facilitate cross-border digital
payments. In July 2023 Indonesia and India signed an agreement to link cross-
border payments using QR codes. Discussion is under way to link QRIS (the
Indonesian QR payment system) with Hong Kong and Japan's QR payment
tool.

Indonesia has a low level of life-insurance penetration and few statutory
requirements for insurance coverage, such as for vehicles and buildings. Despite
susceptibility to natural disasters including earthquakes, volcanic activity,
tsunamis and floods, few property owners enjoy the protection offered by
insurance. Market constraints include a lack of public awareness, little
immediate purchasing power, poor selling channels and cultural mistrust of
long-term payment commitments. However, in February 2024 government
officials held discussions about the roll-out of government regulations on
mandatory insurance, including third-party liability insurance for motorists, fire
insurance and home insurance against disasters, under Law 4 of 2023 on
Financial Sector Development and Reinforcement. Implementation of this roll-
out will help the insurance market to expand.
The insurance industry is small and fragmented, with premiums equivalent to
only 1.3% of GDP in 2023, according to the latest globally harmonised figures
from Swiss Re, a Zurich-based global reinsurer. This is one of the lowest levels
in developing Asia, and below other ASEAN economies such as Thailand (5.3%),
Malaysia (5.2%) and Vietnam (2.3%).
According to Swiss Re, the insurance industry attracted estimated gross
premiums of Rp279.7trn in 2023, up from Rp275.9trn in 2022. Life insurance is
the dominant segment, but it recorded a 7.4% fall in 2023, accounting for
Rp161.2trn in premiums. The smaller non-life segment pulled in Rp118.5trn in
premiums, up by a robust 16.4% from a year earlier.
According to the OJK, the industry recorded a nominal 2.5% increase in
premiums to Rp533trn in 2022, after 4.2% growth in 2021. In 2023 premium
revenue was Rp551trn, up by 3.5% from 2022. By end-May 2024, premium intake

grew by 5.2%, year on year. OJK and Swiss Re count premiums in different
ways, chiefly because only the former includes social programme
contributions. Real (inflation-adjusted) growth was lower after accounting for
inflation of 1.9% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022.
Insurers' total assets amounted to Rp1,874.5trn at the end of May 2024. Those of
life insurers stood at Rp583.9trn, whereas general insurers held Rp232.5trn,
according to the OJK. Reinsurers held total assets worth Rp39.2trn; social
insurers Rp862.6trn; and mandatory insurers Rp156.2trn.

According to the OJK, social insurance was the largest segment, making up 45%
of total gross premiums in 2023, followed by life insurance (28.5%), general
insurance (20.2%), reinsurance (4.9%) and mandatory insurance, primarily for
civil servants, members of the armed forces and the police (1%).
Foreign firms in joint ventures are important players in life insurance, whereas
privately owned local companies, most of which are connected to large
domestic conglomerates, dominate the general insurance market.
The two state social insurers are BPJS Kesehatan (a national health insurer) and
BPJS Ketenagakerjaan (a provider of accident, life and pension benefits).
Mandatory firms, all state-owned, include Jasa Raharja (which covers road-
accident victims) and Taspen and Asabri (covering civil service and armed
forces pensions, respectively).
According to the BI, there were a total of 49 registered life insurers in December
2023. The group's figures indicate that the life segment recorded a 7.4% fall in
total premium income to Rp157.3trn in 2023, after falling by 7.8% in 2022.
However, the segment covered about 85m Indonesians in 2023, an increase of
0.5% from 2022, according to Indonesia Life Insurance Association. Total sums
insured amounted to Rp5,343.4trn, an increase of 9.9%. Total claims and benefits
paid by life insurers in 2023 were recorded at Rp162.8trn.

Jiwasraya, a large state-owned life insurer, went through restructuring in 2021
following violations related to wild investment strategies and the mispricing of
products, among other irregularities. Bad investments led to default on more
than 10,000 policies sold through bancassurance in 2018. Senior executives at
the firm, including its former president and chief financial officer, were
convicted of fraud and sentenced to life in prison and asset forfeiture in 2020.
An audit indicated that the company reported negative equity of US$2bn amid
violations of investment guidelines and a failure to pay out on customer claims.
The majority of its customers later agreed to a restructuring offer.
The House of People's Representatives (DPR, the legislature) approved
additional funds worth Rp22trn for disbursement in 2022 for the restructuring
of Jiwasraya. Asuransi Jiwa IFG (or IFG Life) is co-ordinating with Jiwasraya to
verify and validate policies whose holders have agreed to restructuring. IFG Life
was formed by Indonesia Financial Group (IFG) to become a transfer insurance
company for Jiwasraya policies. IFG was launched in 2020 as an insurance and
underwriting holding under the auspices of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The
media, however, has continued to raise concerns over the legitimacy of the
auction of Jiwasraya assets.
There were 72 general insurers and seven reinsurers in May 2024, according to
the OJK. There were also more than 150 insurance brokers and more than
30 reinsurance brokers.
The largest firm in the general segment by premiums is Asuransi Kredit
Indonesia (Askrindo), which is one of ten firms held by the state-owned IFG
holding company. Smaller firms include the domestic Asuransi Astra Buana,
BRI Asuransi Indonesia, PT Asuransi Sinar Mas, Asuransi Tugu Pratama
Indonesia (also domestic and majority-owned by Pertamina, the state oil-and-
gas company, with minority foreign shareholders) and Zurich Asuransi
Indonesia (a unit of Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Group).
Property insurance contributed about 25.5% of general insurance premiums in
2023, followed by credit insurance (21.5%), motor insurance (18.8%) and personal
accident and health insurance (9.1%). In terms of claims, credit insurance was

the largest segment, accounting for about 37% of the total, followed by personal
accident and health insurance (15.5%), motor vehicle insurance (15.3%) and
property insurance (14.7%).
Medical insurance coverage is growing quickly, as most hospitals refuse
treatment without evidence that an insurer will pay the bill or that the patient
can pay upfront. The government is extending health cover under its National
Health Insurance scheme (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, or JKN), the roll-out of
which began in 2014. The government is aiming for universal coverage of the
entire population of over 275m. As at March 2023 the number of beneficiaries
of the programme was around 267m, or 95.8% of the population, according to
the country’s social security agency. The JKN continues to accrue large deficits
each year. Private insurance is expected to play a role in the system by
providing for excess or additional coverage of services, including getting
treatment abroad, not included in the JKN.

Indonesia's asset-management industry is small by South-east Asian standards,
underlining the country's low levels of household wealth, which limit demand
for investment products. Indonesia's pension assets are meagre compared with
those of other developing countries. Once highly concentrated, the country's
mutual-fund segment is slowly becoming more competitive, although the
ten largest fund managers still account for nearly 70% of the market.
The mutual-fund segment has grown rapidly in recent years. The total net asset
value of mutual funds stood at Rp505trn at end-2023, down from Rp508trn at
end-2022 and nearly Rp580trn at end-2021, but otherwise maintaining a general
upward trend from Rp193.6trn at end-2013. The data stood at Rp497.6trn at end-
July 2024. Fixed-income funds (28.2%) were the largest category of the industry's

Foreign investors are active in the Indonesian market. Examples of international
market players include Manulife (Canada), Schroder (UK) and BNP Paribas
(France). However, in 2021 Abrdn, formerly Standard Life Aberdeen (UK),
decided to close its asset-management business in Indonesia as part of a
reconfiguration of its global operations.
Several state entities provide pension coverage and other social welfare benefits
for the population. The Employment Social Security Agency
(BPJS Ketenagakerjaan), operates funds that cover more than 50m private-sector
workers against accidents at work and wage-earner death. The agency operates
four labour social security programmes to cover different groups: formal
workers, informal workers, construction workers and immigrant workers.
The Health Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan) is charged with managing
the healthcare benefits of enrolees.
A new system of employment benefits—part of the National Social Security
System (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional, or SJSN)—provides old-age pensions,
workplace accident benefits, pension and death benefits and basic healthcare.
Its introduction exerts competitive pressure on the private pension and wealth
management provider, as well as insurance industries.
A large number of Indonesians remain outside the pension system, relying on
savings and traditional family-support networks. This is in part owing to the
large informal economy. However, private employers sometimes offer
occupational pension plans for their staff, which can be either defined-benefit
or defined-contribution plans. According to the OJK, the number of such funds
had edged down to 194 at end-2023, from 197 at end-2022 and 208 at end-2021,
whereas assets had increased to Rp363.2trn at end-2023, from Rp340.7trn at

Financial institutions have offered voluntary private pension plans since the
late 1990s, but initial uptake was limited by poor investment returns and
market volatility. More recently, there has been a trend for employers to
outsource the operations of pension funds to financial institutions. Ownership
of pension funds is closed to foreign investors.

The Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) remains small in terms of market
capitalisation in comparison with the size of the country's economy, but has
been developing rapidly. Having emerged from the 2007 merger of the Jakarta
and Surabaya exchanges, the IDX does not have its own share listing but is
owned by more than 100 securities companies. Complementary institutions are
the Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation and the Indonesian
Central Securities Depository.
The IDX trades a variety of financial instruments, including stocks, bonds,
mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), real estate and infrastructure trusts
(REITs), derivatives and warrants.
The IDX share market has three boards: a main board covering large companies
with established track records; a development board aimed at firms unable to
meet main board requirements or undergoing reorganisation; and an
acceleration board for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) raising funds
for expansion.
The benchmark Jakarta Composite Index, which covers all stocks, ended 2023 at
7,273 points, marking a year-on-year rise of 6.2%. The index grew by 4.1% in 2022
and 10.1% in 2021, following a drop of 5.1% in 2020 (its first annual decline
since 2017). The index has gained about 5% in the first eight months of 2024.
Market-friendly reforms, including dedicated frameworks for innovative firms,
have encouraged more local start-ups to pursue IPOs at the exchange over the
past few years. The IDX attracted at least 77 new listings in 2023, up from 59 in
2022. Amman Mineral Internasional, the country's second-largest copper and
gold producer, was the highest-value IPO in 2023, worth US$713.4m. In 2022 the
largest IPO in terms of value was GoTo Group (formed through a merger
between Gojek, a ride-hailing giant, and Tokopedia, an e-commerce firm),
which raised US1.1bn.
There were 902 companies listed on the IDX at end-2023, up from 825 at
end-2022 and 766 at end-2021. As at early September 2024, 37 additional
companies had listed on the exchange. In contrast with the share market, the
market for other instruments remains underdeveloped. There were 168 options
contracts, 18 futures contracts, 77 warrants, 50 listed ETFs, three listed REITs and
just one infrastructure fund at end-2023.

In November 2023 the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) added the IDX as a
recognised exchange. Companies with a primary listing on the IDX’s main
market can now apply for a secondary listing in Hong Kong.
The Indonesian bond market, which is based at the IDX, is small in comparison
with its Asian peers and is dominated by government securities. Corporates
still depend largely on banking facilities for their financing needs, and foreign
currency-denominated borrowings are also limited. However, the market has
advanced in recent years as more companies have come to be considered
sufficiently creditworthy to issue bonds. The corporate-bond landscape is
dominated by large banks and financial, mining and utilities firms, and the
quality of corporate paper is generally high. According to BI, there are 331 listed
companies issuing bonds.

At end-July 2024 there were 199 government bond issues with an outstanding
value of Rp6,185.2trn. There were also four US-dollar-denominated issues, with
a value of US$502.9m. Meanwhile, there were 132 corporate issuers, with 1,020
bonds valued at a total of Rp466.5trn, plus 25 additional dollar-denominated
issuances with a toal value of US$60.2m, according to the IDX.
Indonesia's foreign-exchange market is smaller than those of Malaysia and
Thailand, and is minuscule compared with those in Singapore and Hong Kong.
A daily average of US$11.6bn was traded over-the-counter in Indonesia in
April 2022, up from US$6.7bn in April 2019, according to the Triennial Survey
from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Of the April 2022 volume,
75% was in the spot market, 15.3% in foreign-exchange swaps, 7.4% in outright
forwards and smaller amounts in currency swaps and options.
Volumes are higher on Jakarta's US-dollar interbank call money market; nearly
all of this volume is in one-day maturities. Although small, Indonesia's onshore
foreign-exchange market has become more diversified in recent years. The use
of derivatives like foreign-currency exchange swaps for hedging has risen.
Businesses and financial institutions can also hedge against foreign-exchange
risks via the domestic non-deliverable forward (DNDF), which BI introduced in
2018. The intention is to bring some offshore transactions onshore, where local
regulators have greater oversight. Regulations on DNDF transactions were
relaxed in 2019, allowing small transactions without underlying documents and

BI has pursued swap auctions and currency-swap arrangements to improve
liquidity in foreign-exchange markets and to allow banks and firms to hedge
against foreign-exchange risks. These have also helped the government to
increase its stock of US-dollar reserves and to stabilise its currency. The foreign-
exchange reserves have improved the financial stability of the country.
In November 2023 the central bank and the Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS, the city state's central bank) renewed a currency swap agreement. This
follows the renewal of pacts with Malaysia in September 2022, Australia in
February 2022, China in January 2022 and Japan in October 2021. Indonesia
has already completed bilateral swap agreements with South Korea and
Thailand. Furthermore, Indonesia is party to the Chiang Mai Initiative
multilateralisation agreement and the ASEAN Swap Arrangement.
Financial regulation
Overview Indonesia's financial institutions are now better insulated from the sort of
damage that devastated the country's economy—and the banking industry in
particular—during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Sustained and generally
more responsible credit growth and lower NPL ratios, as well as good returns
on assets, healthy capital adequacy ratios (CARs) and sound loan-deposit ratios,
have strengthened banks and other financial entities. In addition, these
institutions have little direct overseas exposure, and the regulatory safeguards
instituted since the Asian financial crisis have helped to make the financial
sector more resilient.
The principal regulator is the Financial Services Authority (OJK). It took over
responsibility for bank licensing, regulation and supervision from BI at the end
of 2013. It previously had authority over non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs),
including insurance, brokerage, financial technology (fintech) companies and

capital markets. The central bank retains responsibility for monetary policy, the
overall stability of the financial sector and the integrity of Indonesia's
payments system.
The Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) was established in 2004 as
an independent institution to insure customers' deposits and to play a role in
maintaining stability in the banking system.
An overarching co-ordinating body, the Financial System Stability Committee
(Komite Stabilitas Sistem Keuangan), was created in 2013. Its voting members
are the minister of finance, the BI governor and the chairman of the OJK, while
the chairman of the LPS is a non-voting member.
Only the world's 200 largest banks by assets are permitted to open branches in
Indonesia. The combined holding of foreign investors in a local bank is
permitted to reach 99%, although caps apply to single holdings (by both local
and foreign investors). Holdings by financial institutions are limited to 40%,
although bank shareholders may be permitted to exceed this limit under
certain conditions. For NBFIs and private individuals, the limits are 30% and
20%, respectively.
Central-bank approval is not always forthcoming for foreign investment. In 2013
BI rejected an attempt by Singapore's DBS Bank to secure a majority stake in the
locally based Bank Danamon Indonesia. Temasek Holdings (a Singaporean
sovereign wealth fund) is DBS Bank's owner. However, in 2019 the central bank
allowed Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (Japan) to secure a 94% stake in Bank
Danamon Indonesia, in the final stage of a three-step transaction with Temasek.
The Financial System Crisis Prevention and Mitigation Law institutes new rules
regarding the treatment of systemically important banks. It states that a major
bank that encounters solvency problems will need to be either rescued through
an injection of funds by its shareholders (through a bail-in scheme) or taken
over by the LPS if the bail-in fails. Nonetheless, given the limited financial
resources available to the LPS, most believe that the government (using public
funds) would need to step in as a lender of last resort if the stability of the
financial system appeared to be at risk.
As a member of the G20, Indonesia has a seat at the table for international
financial regulatory standards, including the Basel III framework. According to
the BIS, the country's regulators had adopted 22 of 24 applicable standards by
September 2023. Two others were in progress, concerning margin rules for over-
the-counter derivatives and capital for central counterparties.
Tougher regulatory requirements for capital buffers have compelled institutions
to strengthen their equity bases: Basel III required full implementation at the
start of 2019. The reforms raised the minimum common-equity requirement for
all banks from 3.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) to 4.5%, and stipulated an
additional "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% of RWAs, raising the total
common equity standard to 7% from 2019.
Equity requirements for insurers are increasing, too. The OJK has increased
insurers’ minimum equity requirements, setting the new threshold at Rp250bn
(US$16m) by end-2026, up from a minimum of Rp150bn previously. The OJK
plans to elevate this minimum requirement further, proposing a range of

Rp500bn-Rp1trn (US$32m-US$63m) by 2028. Additionally, the new regulations
stipulate that investors looking to start a new insurance business must invest a
minimum of Rp1trn. For reinsurers, the minimum capital will be raised from
Rp300bn to Rp500bn by 2026, with a further increase to Rp2trn planned for
end-2028. The regulations are intended to improve the resilience of the
insurance industry, and were followed in November 2023 by a new insurance
regulatory roadmap for 2023-27. The roadmap aims to improve insurance
businesses' resilience and competitiveness, accelerate digital transformation and
reinforce regulation, supervision and licensing.
The OJK recognises the growing significance of the fintech industry, which is
helping the country to achieve greater financial inclusion, but it is taking steps
to regulate the industry. In 2016 the authority issued regulations governing
fintech firms—particularly those that offer peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. The law
states that these firms must secure a business licence, which will be provided
subject to a minimum capital requirement. Under new rules issued in July 2022,
P2P lending entities have to abide by a minimum paid-up capital of Rp25bn,
up from Rp1bn, and maintain equity of at least Rp12.5bn. Shareholders are
subject to a lock-in period of three years. As at December 2023, 51% of
outstanding P2P loans were channelled by banks, up from 41% in December
2022, according to the OJK. OJK frequently sanctions fintech lenders and
revokes their licences when it finds them to be non-compliant.
In February 2024 the OJK updated the fintech regulatory framework to facilitate
and regulate technological innovations in the financial sector. The new
regulations streamline the process for launching fintech products by eliminating
the recordation stage and introducing a clear licensing requirement. The
regulatory sandbox regime has been enhanced with clearer eligibility criteria
and clearly defined guidelines for testing and exiting the sandbox. In addition,
regulatory authority over digital financial assets has been transferred from the
Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency to the OJK.
There is, however, no specific and separate licence for digital banking entities,
which fall under the purview of commercial banking laws. The OJK issued new
regulations on digital banks that took effect in October 2021, with the aim of
encouraging the acceleration of digital transformation in the banking industry
and allowing greater participation by foreign investors. The regulator will
continue to focus on expanding access to financing for micro, small and
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) by improving the ecosystem for
digitalisation and inclusive lending. In late 2023 the OJK released a new
regulatory framework designed to guide banks in the development of digital
services. With the framework, officials aim to provide fair competition and
guidance for banks in developing digital services and assessing digital maturity.
In January 2024 the Indonesian government announced that a digital ID and
an instant digital payments service would be launched in the second half of
2024, as the country seeks to build out its digital infrastructure.
Indonesia has improved its regulations related to money-laundering and the
financing of terrorism. In 2015 the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global
intergovernmental body, released the country from its ongoing compliance

process, following progress in remedying deficiencies identified in 2010.
The OJK and BI introduced detailed rules in 2017 for the handling of
transactions and the reporting of suspicious payments.
In recent years, BI has been taking steps to make credit more accessible to
consumers. To boost home and vehicle ownership, including green buildings
and vehicles (cost-effective cars with relatively small engines or renewable
energy), BI has relaxed the rules related to loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, reducing
down-payment obligations for property buyers. BI raised the maximum LTV
ratio for property purchases (for houses larger than 70 sq metres) to 85% in 2016.
In 2019 the central bank relaxed the permissible LTV and financing-to-value
(FTV) ratios further, in a bid to boost home and vehicle ownership. Between
March and December 2021 the LTV/FTV ratio on housing loans/financing was
relaxed again, to 100%, for banks meeting specific criteria on NPLs and non-
performing financing.
As Indonesia is vulnerable to the impact of climate change, government efforts
to reduce climate emissions have increased, and both BI and the OJK have in
recent years encouraged and required financial institutions to engage in
sustainable financing. In January 2022 the OJK launched the Green Taxonomy
Programme, which provides guidelines for prospective investors in relation to
sustainable financing. The programme covers more than 900 businesses and
categorises the potential environmental damage of a company's operations into
three tiers: green, which indicates environmental benefits; yellow, which
indicates no damage; and red, which signifies negative environmental effects.
This was later upgraded to "Taxonomy of Indonesian Sustainable Finance" in
February 2024, to improve the coverage of actions and financial products. In
2023 the OJK published guidelines for banks’ climate risk stress testing. In
December 2023 it announced that all banks would be required to factor climate
risks into their lending decisions by 2026. Previously, only banks that were part
of the OJK’s climate task force had to participate in climate stress testing.
Regulatory watchlist An omnibus bill to reform the financial sector and the mandate of BI was
enacted in January 2023. The Financial Sector Development and Reinforcement
Law altered 17 existing statutes related to the financial sector. Many of the
changes relate to the consolidation of regulation and supervision of types of
finance under a smaller number of statutes and clearer purview of the OJK.
It also contains new rules to govern fintech, including improved data
protection. Most of these will prove uncontroversial and will provide more
clarity for investors in the long term.
The changes to BI's mandate are more significant, however. The legislation
contained a provision for the Financial System Stability Committee to direct the
central bank to purchase sovereign bonds in the primary market during periods
of economic crisis, which is viewed as similar to direct debt monetisation. The
initiative was started during the pandemic and was due to be wound down,
but was not. The change risks undermining BI's independence and, in turn,
price stability, by inclining the central bank towards looser monetary policy,
potentially with little regard to price situation, during downturns in growth.

The Omnibus Law on Job Creation, the flagship economic programme of the
outgoing president, Joko Widodo (known as Jokowi), came into force in early
2021. Although the programme was ruled unconstitutional on procedural
grounds, the government re-enacted it with effect from end-2022. It is an
ambitious set of legislative amendments that aims to streamline the process of
setting up a new business and to reduce the cost burden on existing enterprises.
It promises a substantial cut in corporation tax to 20%, as well as easier
subcontracting for employers, the revocation of some construction
requirements and building permits, and a broadening of sectors open to
foreign investment. This provides benefits to the financial service sector, as
demand for financing is expected to strengthen and access to the financial
market for foreign businesses is widened.
One of the plans under the Omnibus Law was to create an agency to manage
Indonesia's investment. Subsequently, in 2021, the Indonesia Investment
Authority (INA) was established as the country's sovereign wealth fund.
According to its website, its specific purpose is to build wealth for future
generations and to contribute to Indonesia's economic development. The INA
managed Rp99.9trn in assets at end-2022, based on capital injected by
the government.
In November 2022 BI announced that it had begun a consultative process to
unveil a central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiative known as
Project Garuda. The central bank confirmed in January 2024 that it plans to start
with a basic wholesale CBDC in Phase 1 and to progress to integration with a
securities ledger for Phase 2. The ultimate goal is to launch an end-to-end
integration of wholesale and retail digital rupiah as part of Phase 3.
The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has long endorsed
financial integration and has made progress on digital-payment linkages, but
has made few tangible advances in linking the region's banks and exchanges.
The organisation's current plans endorse the liberation of both capital accounts
and financial services until the end of 2025, as well as capital market
development. We anticipate that regulators will (on a piecemeal basis) grant
more operating licences to financial firms from other territories in the region
and will approve more, albeit only specific, bilateral trading arrangements in
the coming years.
Monetary and currency policy
Monetary policy BI is likely to begin easing monetary policy in October. Its latest change was to
raise its policy rate to 6.25% in April 2024—its highest level on record—to
counteract depreciatory pressure on the local currency, the rupiah, stemming
from the interest-rate differential between Indonesia and the US. We believe
that the trigger for the first rate cut will be the Federal Reserve (Fed, the US
central bank) beginning to ease its own monetary policy in September, which
should soothe BI's worries about further depreciation risks. With inflation
likely to remain within BI's target range of 1.5-3.5%, we expect a gradual easing
to continue thereafter and into 2025.

We anticipate that Mr Trump's likely return as US president will create an
inflationary environment in the US and a more hawkish Fed in 2025-28. This
will restrain BI's room to cut policy rates further, in order to support the rupiah.
We consequently expect the central bank to maintain its policy rate within the
4.5-5.25% range over 2026-28, in order to balance inflationary and currency
pressures against maintaining economic growth.
Exchange rates We expect that the result of the US election, in which our baseline forecast is for
Donald Trump to win, will see some of the recent appreciation in the rupiah
unwind in the tail end of this year, as global risk sentiment sours and investors
reassess their expectations for monetary easing in the US. We expect the
currency to depreciate to nearly Rp16,000:US$1, by the end of 2024.

Indonesia at a glance
Elections: Prabowo Subianto, representing the Great Indonesia Movement
Party (Gerindra), won the presidential election in February 2024 and is set to
become the president later this year. He was the defence minister in the
outgoing government led by the current president, Joko Widodo (known as
Jokowi). Jokowi took office in October 2014 and will remain in office until his
term ends in October 2024. He won a second presidential term following
elections in April 2019, when parliamentary and presidential elections were
held concurrently for the first time in Indonesia's history. He was sworn in for a
second term in October 2019. Under the country's constitution, Jokowi is
ineligible to be president again. The next parliamentary and presidential
elections are scheduled for February 2024.
Government: The presidency is the highest executive office, with authority to
appoint the cabinet. The People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) consists of a
575-member House of People's Representatives (DPR) and a 136-member
Regional Representatives' Council (DPD).
Major political parties: There are three nationalist secular parties: the
Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), Golkar and the Democratic Party
(PD). Four other parties—the National Awakening Party (PKB), the National
Mandate Party (PAN), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the United
Development Party (PPP)—have an Islamic orientation. The Great Indonesia
Movement Party (Gerindra) and the National Democratic Party (NasDem) also
hold seats in the DPR.
Fiscal year: January-December.
